PreProject:
I will be making a basic site based only on HTML. This is the project/exam for TOP HTML, and after I finish this I will be continuing with CSS. I really am looking forward to doing JavaScript though.

PostProject:
Okay, honestly, I have had so many HTML tasks, and the steps would have just been repeptitive, so I slightly skipped this and pushed the code with git to github. I might still make it more pretty later (this page) with all steps included, but for now I want to get into learning Javascript asap.
